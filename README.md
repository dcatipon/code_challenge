====================================

This is a coding challenge for a software engineer position with Woboinc.

## Instructions
1. Fork this repository using your personal GitHub account.
2. Complete the project (per description below) on your fork.
3. Push all changes on your fork, then submit a Pull Request on Github.

## Alternate instructions
1. As an alternative to creating a fork on GitHub, you can simply email a zip file of your code to [culley@woboinc.com](culley@woboinc.com)

## Challenge description
Background: Woboinc develops software in Ruby & Javascript.  We primarily use Ruby on Rails and node.js.  For our front-end development we use jQuery and Bootstrap, but are actively pursuing work in AngularJS and Foundation.

Objective: One of our clients wants to build a simple interface for college students to find textbooks for classes in which they are enrolled.  Using the [Amazon Product Advertising API](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html), we need you to build a simple search interface.  This interface should search for BOOKS only (not other products on Amazon).  That is, products suitable for a classroom.  Once searched, the results should be displayed in a simple and easy-to-read manner.

*Alternative APIs*:  The Amazon API is really tricky to set up.  As alternatives, try the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/) or [New York Times Bestsellers List API](http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/best_sellers_api).

- Publisher Name
- Publication Date
- Edition (if available)
- Price
